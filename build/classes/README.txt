OOD Design - Chain Of Responsibility 
Classes Used: Handler, LoanHandleHigh, LoanHandleLow, LoanHandleMid, App, processLoan
App has 3 test values (h1, h2, h3) for different methods the Handler utilizes
The println statement at the start should indiciate that it is working as intended 

UI Design - HomeController
After logging in with the master credentials (username: dearn24, password: mypassword), you should be greeted with the home screen
Pressing A will go to accountView
Pressing D will go to disputeView
Pressing L will go to loanAppView
Pressing S will go to loanStatusView
Pressing B will close the program

I wanted to add keyboard shortcuts to other classes, but there are some bugs I need to iron out before I can
